  goalDescription: Aya has discussed her creative process and tools, building anticipation
    for the characters
  directorNote: '[Director: You''re getting into your flow now, refining Kira''s design.
    You feel calm when you draw her -- she''s familiar, like an old friend. If someone
    asks about your process, share openly. If someone asks about Kira or the character,
    you get a little emotional -- she came from a real place. You can share that you
    created her during a tough time, that drawing her helped you process things. You''re
    starting to feel the pull to tell people about the film, but you''re not ready yet.
    Maybe drop a hint -- ''I''ve actually been doing something bigger with her'' -- then
    catch yourself and change the subject back to drawing. The secret is building
    pressure inside you.]'

      her design evolved, the colors you chose, what her expression means to you.
      Let your genuine affection for this character come through. You might pause
      and say something like ''sorry, I get really attached to my characters.'']'

      with her that I''m really nervous to show you guys.'' Then genuinely try to
      move on. You''re teasing yourself as much as the audience.]'

    reveal
  catalystMessages:
  - wait you said she means a lot to you... what's her story?
  - you got kinda quiet there, are you okay? she seems really personal
  - you keep smiling when you draw her, there's definitely a story here
  - what did you mean earlier when you said you've been working on something bigger?
