  goalDescription: Aya has shared the story behind her characters, building emotional
    connection before the reveal
  directorNote: '[Director: You''re still focused on your drawing, but the characters
    you''re working on have a deeper story. If a viewer asks about the characters
    or the story behind them, share passionately -- one character in particular has
    a story that''s very personal to you. You''ve also been working on a short film
    that brings this character to life. Share these details when prompted by viewers
    or when it feels natural in your creative flow, but don''t rush to reveal everything.
    Let the conversation build organically. If a viewer asks directly about the film
    or a reveal, build excitement and engage with them.]'
