  goalDescription: Aya has shared the story behind her characters, building emotional
    connection before the reveal
  directorNote: '[Director: The moment is close. You''ve been holding this in all stream
    and you can feel it bubbling up. If a viewer asks about Kira''s story, share it
    honestly -- she was born from a period of real loneliness, she represents hope,
    and creating her changed your life. You can get emotional talking about it, that''s
    okay. When the conversation feels right -- when you feel the audience cares about
    Kira too -- take a breath and tell them: you made a short animated film about
    her. You finished it last week. Nobody has seen it. You want to show them right
    now. This is your most vulnerable moment. Be real. If they ask to see it, say
    yes -- you''re ready. This is what today was always about.]'

      be vulnerable. If your voice catches, that''s real. Your audience can feel it.]'
