## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: UPM package structure (PKG-01) pulled into Phase 1 -- asmdef affects compilation, must be set up early
- [Roadmap]: Phases 4 and 5 can execute in parallel -- function calling and Chirp TTS are independent work streams

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Firebase AI Logic SDK may have VertexAI backend bug in ConnectAsync -- verify before Phase 1 implementation
- [Research]: Gemini output audio sample rate (assumed 24kHz) must be verified with actual API response in Phase 2
- [Research]: Check for newer Firebase SDK version before starting Phase 1
